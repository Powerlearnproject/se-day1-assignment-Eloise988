#Part 1: Introduction to Sofware Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering entails the step by step application of engineering principles,methodologies to build and maintain software and software systems.
Software engineering is important in technology because it helps in the design and creation of systems that helps our dad to day activities in almost all facets of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include
1: the confirmation of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2: arrival of structured programming in the 1970s
3: rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: the collection of user needs and system requirements 

Design: creating detailed design for the software architecture and user interface

Implementation: involves writing of codes and building the software inline with the design specifications 

Testing: conducting arious tests to ensure software meets certain standards and functional requirements 

Deployment: releasing the software to customers 

Maintenance: providing continuous support,updates and enhancements to the software deployed #


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach where each phase involved must be completed before the next begins 
Th agile model is an iterative approach where work is divided into smaller chcles for continuous delivery 

Waterfall model changes to the project scope are difficult and costly once a phase is completed 
Agile model is adaptive to change 

Extensive documentation is created at each phase for the waterfall methodology 
Agile emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation 

Waterfall is often suited for large, complex projects
Agile works well for smaller projects where requirements are expected to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions

Quality assurance engineer: they ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans

Project Manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes eg Eclipse
Version Control Systems are tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1: Change in requirements during development cycle,leading to scope,creep and project delays
To overcome this, effective communication is crucial

2:Tight deadlines which comes with pressure to deliver software products on schedule 
To overcome this it's important to prioritize tasks

3:Technical debt accrued from shortcuts solutions.
Reassssment of project goals, timelines and methodologies should be done to prevent taking shortcut risks.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.

Integration testing is done between different components or subsystems 

System testing include testing the whole system

Acceptance testing is done inorder to test the softare against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompts engineering entails crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

It is important because it helps how to structure questions so as to get precise answers and avoid getting confused answers 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me about trees"
Improved prompt: "Tell me about the mango tree"

The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, and specific
